# Projektseminar "Data Science II" Wintersemester 2023/24
This repository includes the final version of the code. It contains two parts: the model training and the GUI. The original dataset is not included due to permissions to use the dataset. So the code is only for reading and communicating for learning purpose.

## Title: Seizure Scout - Epilepsy Detection in EEG Signalsâ€‹
Overview of our team:
```
Team name: Data Wizard
Team members: Zhenzhi Li, Zhengyu Shi, Xuanhao Song, Yunxiao Ke, Junyu Zhou, Qiang Dong
Supervisor: Fabian Scheidt
Support: Signal Processing Group of TU Darmstadt / EEG Corpus of Temple University
```
We propose Seizure-Scout, an ensemble learning based machine learning model for non-invasive detection and classification of epileptic seizures in clinical data. A user-friendly graphical interface allows Doctors and Analysts to get diagnostic insights  and support decisions making. Our software product bears the potential to become a prototype for a standard software application and lock-in effects.
